## What is Included
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data cleaning, open-coding, reconciliation, and data analysis
- `figures/`: Aggregate plots of survey data (broken down at the role-level)

## What is Not Included
In order to fully follow our approved protocol and for the sake of anonymity, individual responses are not included in this replication package.  With so few people active in this area, responses may be enough to determine the identities of certain participants.

NOTE: This means that the scripts may not run out of the box.  They require data files in order to function properly.
